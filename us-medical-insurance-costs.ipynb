    "Project Medical Insurance Costs is a **portfolio project** from **Codecademy** **Data Science Career Path**. This project is a part of Data Science Foundation path that uses Python to analyze data from a CSV file.The data is about the medical insurance costs of a person.\n",

    "The data **insurance.csv** contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- age: Patient age in years.\n",
    "- sex: Patient gender (female or male).\n",
    "- bmi: Patient body mass index.\n",
    "- children: Patient number of children covered by health insurance.\n",
    "- smoker: Patient smoking status (yes or no).\n",

    "- To find out the average age of the patients in the dataset.\n",
    "- To find out the number of each sex comprised in the dataset.\n",
    "- To find out the geographical location of the patients in the dataset.\n",
    "- To find out the average medical insurance costs of the patients in the dataset.\n",

    "## Understanding `.gitattributes`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.gitattributes` file is a simple text file that gives attributes to pathnames. Each line in the `.gitattributes` file is a pattern followed by an attribute specification. It's placed in the root directory of a repository or in any subdirectory (the latter being useful for applying attributes to only a subset of the repository). The file is committed into the repository and versioned like any other file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the `.gitattributes` file contains the following lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```properties\n",
    "*.ipynb filter=nbstripout\n",
    "*.zpln filter=nbstripout\n",
    "*.ipynb diff=ipynb\n",
    "* text=auto eol=lf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what each line does:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `*.ipynb filter=nbstripout` and `*.zpln filter=nbstripout`: These lines tell Git to use the `nbstripout` filter for files ending in `.ipynb` and `.zpln`. `nbstripout` is a tool that strips output from Jupyter notebooks. This is useful because it allows you to commit only the code changes in your notebooks, not the output. This can make your commits cleaner and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `*.ipynb diff=ipynb`: This line tells Git to use the `ipynb` diff tool when comparing changes in `.ipynb` files. This can make diffs of Jupyter notebooks more meaningful, as it understands the structure of notebook files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `* text=auto eol=lf`: This line tells Git to normalize all text files to use LF (Unix-style) line endings. This can help prevent issues with line endings differing between Windows and Unix systems, making your code more consistent and easier to work with across different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `.gitattributes` file in this repository is used to improve the handling of Jupyter notebooks and line endings in Git.\n"
