    "Project Medical Insurance Costs is a **portfolio project** from **Codecademy** **Data Science Career Path**. This project is a part of Data Science Foundation path that uses Python to analyze data from a CSV file.The data is about the medical insurance costs of a person.\n",

    "The data **insurance.csv** contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- age: Patient age in years.\n",
    "- sex: Patient gender (female or male).\n",
    "- bmi: Patient body mass index.\n",
    "- children: Patient number of children covered by health insurance.\n",
    "- smoker: Patient smoking status (yes or no).\n",
    "- region: Patient U.S Geopraphical Region: northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.\n",
    "- charges: Patient Yearly Medical Insurance Cost.\n"

    "\n",
    "- To analyze the data using Python by building out functions or class methods.\n",
    "- To find out the average age of the patients in the dataset.\n",
    "- To find out the number of each sex comprised in the dataset.\n",
    "- To find out the geographical location of the patients in the dataset.\n",
    "- To find out the average medical insurance costs of the patients in the dataset.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary that contains all patient information.\n",
    "- To estimate the medical insurance costs for a new patient with regression analysis.\n"
